        <h2>The Thiruvalleeswarar Temple, located in the Padi area of Chennai, is an ancient and revered Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. This historic shrine is a "Paadal Petra Sthalam," one of the 275 Shiva temples celebrated in the 7th-century Tamil canonical work, the Tevaram, and features a unique Gajaprishta (elephant-back) style vimana (sanctum tower). Legend has it that the presiding deity was worshipped by several figures, including Sage Bharadwaja (in the form of a sparrow), Lord Rama, Hanuman, the Sun, and the Moon Gods. Notably, the temple is a significant Guru Parihara Sthalam (a remedial place of worship for the planet Jupiter), with a special shrine for Guru Bhagavan, where devotees offer yellow clothes and chickpea garlands on Thursdays to mitigate adverse planetary effects and seek blessings for wisdom and marriage. The temple also uniquely features Lord Ganesha with his two consorts, Kamali and Valli, making it a place of prayer for those seeking marriage alliances.
